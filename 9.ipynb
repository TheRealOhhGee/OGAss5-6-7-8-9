This dataset consists of ratings on a scale of 1 to 5. The dataset has $n_u = 943$ users, and $n_m = 1682$ movies. \n\nIn the next parts of this exercise, you will implement the function `cofiCostFunc` that computes the collaborative filtering objective function and gradient. After implementing the cost function and gradient, you will use `scipy.optimize.minimize` to learn the parameters for collaborative filtering.\n\n### 2.1 Movie ratings dataset\n\nThe next cell will load the dataset `ex8_movies.mat`, providing the variables `Y` and `R`.\nThe matrix `Y` (a `num_movies` $\\times$ `num_users` matrix) stores the ratings $y^{(i,j)}$ (from 1 to 5). The matrix `R` is an binary-valued indicator matrix, where $R(i, j) = 1$ if user $j$ gave a rating to movie $i$, and $R(i, j) = 0$ otherwise. The objective of collaborative filtering is to predict movie ratings for the movies that users have not yet rated, that is, the entries with $R(i, j) = 0$. This will allow us to recommend the movies with the highest predicted ratings to the user.\n\nTo help you understand the matrix `Y`, the following cell will compute the average movie rating for the first movie (Toy Story) and print its average rating."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Load data\ndata = loadmat(os.path.join('Data', 'ex8_movies.mat'))\nY, R = data['Y'], data['R']\n\n# Y is a 1682x943 matrix, containing ratings (1-5) of \n# 1682 movies on 943 users\n\n# R is a 1682x943 matrix, where R(i,j) = 1 \n# if and only if user j gave a rating to movie i\n\n# From the matrix, we can compute statistics like average rating.\nprint('Average rating for movie 1 (Toy Story): %f / 5' %\n      np.mean(Y[0, R[0, :] == 1]))\n\n# We can \"visualize\" the ratings matrix by plotting it with imshow\npyplot.figure(figsize=(8, 8))\npyplot.imshow(Y)\npyplot.ylabel('Movies')\npyplot.xlabel('Users')\npyplot.grid(False)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Throughout this part of the exercise, you will also be working with the matrices, `X` and `Theta`:\n\n$$ \\text{X} = \n\\begin{bmatrix}\n- \\left(x^{(1)}\\right)^T - \\\\\n- \\left(x^{(2)}\\right)^T - \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\n- \\left(x^{(n_m)}\\right)^T - \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}, \\quad\n\\text{Theta} = \n\\begin{bmatrix}\n- \\left(\\theta^{(1)}\\right)^T - \\\\\n- \\left(\\theta^{(2)}\\right)^T - \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\n- \\left(\\theta^{(n_u)}\\right)^T - \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n$$\n\nThe $i^{th}$ row of `X` corresponds to the feature vector $x^{(i)}$ for the $i^{th}$ movie, and the $j^{th}$ row of `Theta` corresponds to one parameter vector $\\theta^{(j)}$, for the $j^{th}$ user. Both $x^{(i)}$ and $\\theta^{(j)}$ are n-dimensional vectors. For the purposes of this exercise, you will use $n = 100$, and therefore, $x^{(i)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{100}$ and $\\theta^{(j)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{100}$. Correspondingly, `X` is a $n_m \\times 100$ matrix and `Theta` is a $n_u \\times 100$ matrix.\n\n<a id=\"section3\"></a>\n### 2.2 Collaborative filtering learning algorithm\n\nNow, you will start implementing the collaborative filtering learning algorithm. You will start by implementing the cost function (without regularization).\n\nThe collaborative filtering algorithm in the setting of movie recommendations considers a set of n-dimensional parameter vectors $x^{(1)}, \\dots, x^{(n_m)}$ and $\\theta^{(1)} , \\dots, \\theta^{(n_u)}$, where the model predicts the rating for movie $i$ by user $j$ as $y^{(i,j)} = \\left( \\theta^{(j)} \\right)^T x^{(i)}$. Given a dataset that consists of a set of ratings produced by some users on some movies, you wish to learn the parameter vectors $x^{(1)}, \\dots, x^{(n_m)}, \\theta^{(1)}, \\dots, \\theta^{(n_u)}$ that produce the best fit (minimizes the squared error).\n\nYou will complete the code in `cofiCostFunc` to compute the cost function and gradient for collaborative filtering. Note that the parameters to the function (i.e., the values that you are trying to learn) are `X` and `Theta`. In order to use an off-the-shelf minimizer such as `scipy`'s `minimize` function, the cost function has been set up to unroll the parameters into a single vector called `params`. You had previously used the same vector unrolling method in the neural networks programming exercise.\n\n#### 2.2.1 Collaborative filtering cost function\n\nThe collaborative filtering cost function (without regularization) is given by\n\n$$\nJ(x^{(1)}, \\dots, x^{(n_m)}, \\theta^{(1)}, \\dots,\\theta^{(n_u)}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{(i,j):r(i,j)=1} \\left( \\left(\\theta^{(j)}\\right)^T x^{(i)} - y^{(i,j)} \\right)^2\n$$\n\nYou should now modify the function `cofiCostFunc` to return this cost in the variable `J`. Note that you should be accumulating the cost for user $j$ and movie $i$ only if `R[i,j] = 1`.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n**Implementation Note**: We strongly encourage you to use a vectorized implementation to compute $J$, since it will later by called many times by `scipy`'s optimization package. As usual, it might be easiest to first write a non-vectorized implementation (to make sure you have the right answer), and the modify it to become a vectorized implementation (checking that the vectorization steps do not change your algorithm’s output). To come up with a vectorized implementation, the following tip might be helpful: You can use the $R$ matrix to set selected entries to 0. For example, `R * M` will do an element-wise multiplication between `M`\nand `R`; since `R` only has elements with values either 0 or 1, this has the effect of setting the elements of M to 0 only when the corresponding value in R is 0. Hence, `np.sum( R * M)` is the sum of all the elements of `M` for which the corresponding element in `R` equals 1.\n</div>\n\n<a id=\"cofiCostFunc\"></a>"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def cofiCostFunc(params, Y, R, num_users, num_movies,\n                      num_features, lambda_=0.0):\n    \"\"\"\n    Collaborative filtering cost function.\n    \n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    params : array_like\n        The parameters which will be optimized.

To get started, you can implement the gradient with a for-loop over movies\n(for computing $\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial x^{(i)}_k}$) and a for-loop over users (for computing $\\frac{\\partial J}{\\theta_k^{(j)}}$). When you first implement the gradient, you might start with an unvectorized version, by implementing another inner for-loop that computes each element in the summation. After you have completed the gradient computation this way, you should try to vectorize your implementation (vectorize the inner for-loops), so that you are left with only two for-loops (one for looping over movies to compute $\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial x_k^{(i)}}$ for each movie, and one for looping over users to compute $\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial \\theta_k^{(j)}}$ for each user).\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n**Implementation Tip:** To perform the vectorization, you might find this helpful: You should come up with a way to compute all the derivatives associated with $x_1^{(i)} , x_2^{(i)}, \\dots , x_n^{(i)}$ (i.e., the derivative terms associated with the feature vector $x^{(i)}$) at the same time. Let us define the derivatives for the feature vector of the $i^{th}$ movie as:\n\n$$ \\left(X_{\\text{grad}} \\left(i, :\\right)\\right)^T = \n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial x_1^{(i)}} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial x_2^{(i)}} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial x_n^{(i)}}\n\\end{bmatrix} = \\quad\n\\sum_{j:r(i,j)=1} \\left( \\left( \\theta^{(j)} \\right)^T x^{(i)} - y^{(i,j)} \\right) \\theta^{(j)}\n$$\n\nTo vectorize the above expression, you can start by indexing into `Theta` and `Y` to select only the elements of interests (that is, those with `r[i, j] = 1`). Intuitively, when you consider the features for the $i^{th}$ movie, you only need to be concerned about the users who had given ratings to the movie, and this allows you to remove all the other users from `Theta` and `Y`. <br/><br/>\n\n\nConcretely, you can set `idx = np.where(R[i, :] == 1)[0]` to be a list of all the users that have rated movie $i$. This will allow you to create the temporary matrices `Theta_temp = Theta[idx, :]` and `Y_temp = Y[i, idx]` that index into `Theta` and `Y` to give you only the set of users which have rated the $i^{th}$ movie. This will allow you to write the derivatives as: <br>\n\n`X_grad[i, :] = np.dot(np.dot(X[i, :], Theta_temp.T) - Y_temp, Theta_temp)`\n\n<br><br>\nNote that the vectorized computation above returns a row-vector instead.
